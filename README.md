ssTFTP
========
Open-source implementation of a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
server and client in JAVA.

Description
-----------
ssTFTP is a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) client and server
implementations in JAVA. It was developed for a class in 2008, which I
decided to revive and improve.

The current version (v0.1 beta) implements the TFTP client and server according
to the standard RFC 1350. TFTP Options are not supported in the current version,
being planned for future releases.

Requirements
------------
* Java 7
* Maven (for building)

Build ssTFTP
--------------
ssTFTP is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command
from the project root directory:

    mvn clean install

On the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the
internet and cache them in the local repository (`~/.m2/repository`), which
can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.
