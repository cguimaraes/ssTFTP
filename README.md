ssTFTP
========
Open-source implementation of a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
server and client in JAVA.

Description
-----------
ssTFTP is a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) client and server
implementations in JAVA. It was developed for a class in 2008, which I
decided to revive and improve.

The current version (v0.2 beta) implements the TFTP client and server according
to the standard RFC 1350. TFTP Option Extension, according standard RFC 2347,
is implemented:
 - TFTP Blocksize Option (RFC 2348)
 - TFTP Timeout Interval Option (RFC 2349)
 - TFTP Transfer Size Option (RFC 2349)

For more info, please check CHANGELOG file.

Requirements
------------
* Java 7
* Maven (for building)
* Docker (optional)

Build ssTFTP
--------------
ssTFTP is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command
from the project root directory:

    mvn clean install

or

    cd docker && docker-compose build

On the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the
internet and cache them in the local repository (`~/.m2/repository`), which
can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.
